# Crowdfunding_ETL

## The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:
- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database

### These databases were then transformed to fit the categories of data we were working with and wanted to organize. For example "A category_id column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique categories". There were also columns that needed renamed as well is some of thee databases.

### After we created the Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts dataframes. We then uploaded those dataframes to the Crowdfuncding Database which we made with the help of QuickDBD. After creating eeach schema for the csv files we verified each table had the correct data by running a select statement for each.
